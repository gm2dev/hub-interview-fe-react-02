# GM2 Technical Interview - Dynamic Lists

### General Requirements

1. Googling and any other everyday tool is accepted.
2. All questions are allowed, and even encouraged. As interviewers we can decide not to answer a question if we are evaluating on that topic, but that's for us to decide! Ask away!
3. Code, folders and styling structure must be clean, mantainable and scalable.
4. Styling will be considered, so apply the styles you consider necessary.
